        <h2>StarBoard:</h2>
        StarBoard is a dashboard for stargazers. The homepage includes a visualization of the moon and its phase,
        <br> and weather for the next 12 hours. Included in the weather is GazingScore, a number from 0-100 that
        <br> tells how good the quality of stargazing is at that time. 100 is perfect, 70 is good, 40 is passable, 
        <br>and 0 is impossible. Make sure to turn on location here to allow for weather info and StarFinder capabilities!
        <br>
        <h2>StarFinder:</h2>
        StarFinder shows the 10 brightest objects in the sky. On a clear, dark night, you should be able to see all 10!
        <br> They are ranked by apparent magnitude (brightness from Earth), where lower magnitude means a brighter object.
        <br> Below, you can see a map of the sky, centered facing completely vertical towards north at your location. to move,
        <br> use your mouse to pan. Or, you can click on one of the 10 bright objects and press the "Move To" button below
        <br> the sky map. Happy stargazing!
